While not exactly supported by Apple the &#8220;13-inch, Aluminum, Late 2008&#8243; version of the MacBook (Renamed to MacBook Pro) supports 8GB of Memory.

Originally purchased this Mac with 2GB RAM and Upgraded it to 4GB on day one. Had I known more memory was supported (officially or unofficially) my laptop would have been rocking more RAM much sooner.
