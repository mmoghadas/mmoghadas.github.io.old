I purchased the Blackberry Storm (Verizon Wireless) to satisfy my iPhone thirst. Cool device, but after 6 days of use, I&#8217;m all ready to give up and switch!

The Bluetooth stack crashes my Storm!!! I can duplicate the problem on demand and everytime.

The Bluetooth stack has a mind of its own. The bluetooth device and the phone are paired, but when making a call the phone decides to use the headset instead of the bluetooth. I can manually tell the phone to use the bluetooth device after a call in in progress&#8230;. well sometimes.

Also, the phone gets consistent requests from my car&#8217;s bluetooth device and just wont give up. I cancel this request and BOOM. the phone crashes. Attached is the screenshot of what really happens.

&#8220;Uncaught exception: Application net\_rim\_bb\_phone\_app (72) is not responding: process terminated&#8221; error followed by missing keys in the keyboard(s) layouts.
