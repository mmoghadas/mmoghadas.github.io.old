What is it? An excellent free ticketing system.

Who should use it? Anyone who wants to implement a ticket system for a small business helpdesk.

Requirement? Apache, Perl, Perl Modules and of course RT.

<!--more-->

Install difficulty 1 &#8211; 10? Install process is somewhat time consuming. The hardest part is to get all the Perl modules installed.

Upgrading? Upgrade is very easy if you know what your are doing and follow all the instructions.

Over all this tool can be installed fairly easy if you know what you are doing and have done the install couple of times. I will provide detailed install guide in the next few posts.
