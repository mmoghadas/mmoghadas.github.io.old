I recently migrated my blog from Blogger to WordPress. I added a simple redirect to the old blog (Blogger) to forward to my new blog. Two hours later&#8230; 

- my Google account was locked!  
- my Blogger blog was DELETED!

Fortunately, I was able to recover my account and I had already backed up my blogger content.
